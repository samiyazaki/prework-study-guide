# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work


Prework Study Guide Webpage
Description
This is a simple and introductory attempt at familiarizing myself with both the course content and methodologies. I attempted to follow the instructions provided by the guidelines while still utilizing a developer's mindset to accomplish each task.

I was motivated to create this to become a more competent and prepared developer.
I built this page to familiarize myself with the various methodologies and tools available to the students in my bootcamp.
This allowed me to develop a framework from which to interact with the course content and placed each of the students on a more even playing field, providing context and background knowledge they may not have previously held.
I learned the wide variety of tools that we would employ during our learning, I became more familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as languages and tools as well as how to properly follow the steps to ensure that I can work with a team of developers in the future.
Usage

Credits
I'd like to thank my kids for bothering me every 5 minutes and making this process take way longer than it should have.
